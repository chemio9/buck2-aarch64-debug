/// Maps variable IDs to their access paths for tree-structured DAP protocol variables.
///
/// In the DAP protocol, variables are structured as trees. When a variable with a non-zero ID is encountered,
/// it's expected to have child variables. This struct helps maintain a relationship between variable IDs and their
/// access paths to facilitate evaluation and traversal.
///
/// # Example
///
/// A variable with path "name.field1" that has a child "innerField" will be mapped such that
/// the child's ID corresponds to the access path "name.field1.innerField". This allows correct traversal
/// upon a variable request against the child's ID.
